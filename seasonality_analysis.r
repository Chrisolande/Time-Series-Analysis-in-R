# Inference:
# There is low demand during the nighttime (between midnight and 6 a.m.) and
# high demand between the morning hours and early evening.
# There is a strong correlation between the average demand and its standard
# deviation.
# The relatively low standard deviation of the demand average during the
# nighttime could indicate that there is strong sub-seasonal effect during those
# hours beside the hourly seasonality. This should make sense, as those are normal
# sleep hours, and therefore, on average, the demand is reasonably the same
# throughout the weekdays.
# On the other hand, the high standard deviation throughout the high-demand
# hours could indicate that the demand is distributed differently

# consecutive months, such as May and June). In addition, we can see that, for some months,
# the shape of the distributions is flatter with long tails (mainly during the winter
# monthsâ€”November, December, and January). This could be a result of the volatility in
# some of the exogenous factors; for instance, a combination of weather patterns along with
# the elasticity or sensitivity of the series for changes in weather. For example, in the case of
# natural gas consumption, there is a higher elasticity during the winter months due to the
# dependency of the heating systems for this resource, which does not exist during summer
# time.
